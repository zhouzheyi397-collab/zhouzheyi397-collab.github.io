## About Me

I'm Zhou Zheyi, someone who enjoys stopping to observe the world.

This website is my digital archive, collecting moments worth remembering—photographs, thoughts, feelings, and works that have touched me.

### My Story

I've loved photography since childhood, not for technical prowess or showing off, but to remember feelings that are easily forgotten. A beam of light, a texture, a quiet moment—all can become memories worth preserving.

I believe the best photographs aren't the most perfect, but the most real. Technique can be learned, but that feeling of "being present" cannot be replicated.

### What I Love

- **Observation**: The world is always there, waiting to be discovered
- **Nature**: Mountains, trees, light and shadow, traces left by time
- **Quiet moments**: Sitting by lakes, watching clouds change, listening to wind
- **Warm light**: Sunsets, lamplight, brightness that makes you feel safe
- **Textures**: Wood, tree bark, surfaces worn by time
- **Anime & Film**: Works by Miyazaki, Shinkai, Kore-eda
- **Music**: Joe Hisaishi, Ólafur Arnalds, melodies that quiet the heart

## About This Site

This website is a tribute to the era of early personal websites, when web design was more personal and each site was like a unique digital space.

Built with [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) static site generator, maintaining simplicity and speed.

### Design Philosophy

- **Natural color palette**: Inspired by wood, greenery, and sky in the photographs
- **Early personal site structure**: System UI feel with windows, tabs, and lists
- **Photo-first**: UI doesn't compete with photos but provides comfortable display space
- **Authentic recording**: Not pursuing perfection, just recording real feelings and moments
