## Collections

A record of works that have touched me and the thoughts they've inspired.

### Anime

**Spirited Away**  
*Hayao Miyazaki / 2001*

Each viewing brings new insights. Chihiro's growth in the mysterious world mirrors how we all face the unknown—that mix of fear and curiosity, and ultimately finding our own courage.

Favorite scene: Chihiro sitting on the sea train, quiet and full of hope.

**Your Name**  
*Makoto Shinkai / 2016*

A master of light and shadow aesthetics. Shinkai can make everyday scenes look like dreams. This film made me start noticing the changes of light in daily life, and those overlooked beautiful moments.

### Films

**Little Forest Series**  
*Jun'ichi Mori / 2014-2015*

The aesthetics of slow living. Ichiko's days in Komori village remind me of the importance of stopping to observe the world. Every meal, every seasonal change deserves to be savored.

Impact: Started paying attention to food sources and connection with nature.

**Our Little Sister**  
*Hirokazu Kore-eda / 2015*

Four sisters' daily life, ordinary yet warm. Kore-eda excels at capturing life's details—those unintentional moments are often the most moving.

### Music

**Joe Hisaishi**  
*Studio Ghibli Film Scores*

The theme from "Castle in the Sky" always reminds me of childhood dreams. Hisaishi's music has a magic that can transport you back to the most innocent times.

**Ólafur Arnalds**  
*Icelandic Neoclassical*

Minimalist aesthetics. His music is perfect for quiet moments, like providing a gentle background for contemplation.

Recommendation: "Near Light" - perfect for viewing photographs.

### Books

**Walden**  
*Henry David Thoreau*

"I went to the woods to live deliberately." This book taught me the value of simple living and the importance of dialogue with nature.

**The Art of Photography**  
*Bruce Barnbaum*

More than technical guidance, it's about how to observe the world with heart. "The best photographs are not the most technically perfect, but the most emotional."
